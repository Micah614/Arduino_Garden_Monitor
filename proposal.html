    <h3><u>Introduction: Arduino Prototyping and the IoT</u></h3>
    
    <p>
        Internet-connected devices are currently found in cars, homes, tablets, watches, cell phones, surveillance systems, strap-on monitors, 
        virtual reality equipment, and more. Connected device commerce is expected to expand to a $581.85 billion industry by 2032, 
        according to a recent report by precedenceresearch.com. The increasing prevelance of network-driven devices in the past decade 
        has driven researchers to adopt the term “internet of things”, or “IOT”, for short. This project will explore the fundamental 
        characteristics of IOT devices by developing a Wi-Fi enableed greenhouse monitoring station using Arduino single-board computer 
        chips, the C++ programming language, as well as HTML, CSS, and little bit of JavaScript. The first section of this website is dedicated 
        to completing a series of FreeNove Arduino Project Board tutorials to learn about the Arduino compatible hardware and the 
        integrated development environment (IDE), with the assistance of a Freenove® project board tutorial.

    <h3><u>Project Vision Statement</u></h3>
    
    <p>
        The goal of this project is to develop a wide-area network transceiver device using Arduino compatible boards, hardware, and 
        sensors to relay data about the monitored state colleced by the greenhouse sensors. This project should provide ample learning opportunities 
        and exposure to the following career-relevant concepts...
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Arduino Prototyping.</li>
        <li>Object-Oriented Programming in C/C++ and JavaScript (REACT)</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and other programming languages.</li>
        <li>REST API and Microservice Architecture Patterns.</li>
        <li>Database Design (potentially).</li>
        <li>Network Driver Development and Wireless I/O.</li>
        <li>Real-Time Data Collection and Data Mining Techniques.</li>
        <li>Documentation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>
        <u>Project Motivation</u>
    </h3>

    <p>
        An IT-relevant hobby is a great way to learn new skills, develop a work portfolio, test new ideas, and connect with like-minded 
        individuals. Modern IOT developers need a basic understanding of sensors, controls, drivers, compilers, UX/UI interfaces, 
        databases, and network design to be effective in their roles. Single board computer design is a fun and affordable hobby that 
        offers significant exposure to these practical IT concepts in the form of interesting projects and tutorials. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>

        <li>Complete the final presentation explaining how each section of the project went and share it with GitHub Pages and the rest 
            of the class.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><u>Risks to Completing the Project</u></h3>
    <p>This will be my first Arduino project, so I expect to encounter some technical difficulties along the way. Here are some of the 
        risks to completing the project on time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Broken or missing parts:</strong> Forgetting to purchase a power supply or special component, or needing to replace a 
            broken piece at the wrong time could delay the project timeline by a week or so.</li>
        <li><strong>Running out of memory:</strong> The final device is intended to function as a standalone computer with local and wide 
            area network connectivity. Single board computers contain less memory than a typical computer, however. Running out of 
            on-board memory would require restructuring the code base and rolling development features, either of these outcomes would 
            jeopardize the project timeline and outcome.</li>
        <li><strong>Choosing the right development tools for the job:</strong> It is difficult to know ahead of time every tool that will 
            work best for this project.</li>
        <li><strong>Forgetting a project section:</strong> It is possible that I may have overlooked some critical detail in the project 
            outline. There is also a chance that the project could be significantly more complicated than it is presented to be. Both 
            risks need to be addressed in the project timeline.</li>
        <li><strong>Completing the project in the wrong order:</strong> Performing the development steps in the wrong order could lead to 
            complex bugs involving electrical components. For example, a project task could involve parts or firmware that are incompatible 
            with another section of the project. Troubleshooting a problem such as this could be time-consuming.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>
        <u>
            Mitigation Strategies
        </u>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Broken or Missing Parts:</strong> You can find a list of purchased project materials 
            <a href="./tutorial_code.html" target=”_blank”>here</a>. After ordering the first round of parts, I estimated that the lead 
            time is somewhere between 5 and 7 days for replacement parts. I plan to organize dry run roughly 
            once a week, which should provide time to check the inventory before the next round of development. 
            That way I can identify any missing or broken parts before they become an issue.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Running out of memory:</strong> Memory limitations are a legitimate concern when developing 
            firmware on small computers, since there is often limited memory available in these devices. 
            Recent advances in data storage technology could offer a method to help combat this problem 
            however, and I plan to investigate USB storage expansion options if the occasion ever presents 
            itself. 
            
            Aside from expanding the physical memory of the device, I will also need to exercise common 
            optimization techniques and search for opportunities to used more efficient algorithms to make 
            better use of the space available.             
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Selecting the right development tools:</strong> I have done my best to outline the tools 
            and resources I plan on using for each stage of the project outline. That said, there are likely 
            to be some changes to this plan after I uncover details of building a transmitter device.
            
            I have provided <i>some</i> additional time in the first 5 weeks of the timeline to investigate 
            the tools that I will need to complete the project (tools for developing an asychronous REST API, 
            for example). Therefore, if a tool does not appear to be working as planned, the timeline should 
            be flexible enough to be able to change tools and/or directions whenever this becomes necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Completing project sections in the wrong order:</strong> Again, I have afforded myself a 
            5-week grace period that I can use to reassess the timeline and make changes as I identify them. 
            The first clear objectives of this project seems to 1.) develop a website, and 2.) learn about 
            the Arduino hardware and IDE. Finally, I will need to extract data generated by the device and 
            display this information in a webpage, live-stream and/or statistically summarized format (I 
            would like to investigate data warehousing and OLAP methodologies as well in this project). 
            This is an R&D project, so I expect the connections between concepts to become much clearer as I 
            investigate each project variable in turn.
