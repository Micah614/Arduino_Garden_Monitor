    <h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
    
    <p>Smart devices have become increasingly common in US households. Connected device commerce is expected to expand to a $581.85 
    billion industry by 2032, according to a recent report by precedenceresearch.com. Network connected devices are currently found in cars, 
    homes, tablets, watches, cell phones, surveillance systems, strap-on monitors, virtual reality equipment, and much more. The 
    increasing number of network-connected devices in the last decade has driven researchers to adopt the term “internet of things”, 
    also known as “IOT”. This project will explore the fundamental characteristics of IOT devices by developing a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 
    connected greenhouse monitoring station using Arduino single-board computer parts, extended C/C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
    The first half of this project will involve completing a tutorial about Arduino hardware and the integrated development environment 
    (IDE), which I will complete with the help of Freenove® project board kit that came with the tutorial.</p>

    <h3><u>Vision Statement</u></h3>
    
    <p>The goal of this project is to develop a wide-area network transceiver with Arduino compatible sensors and single-board computing 
        parts. This project should provide a clear learning model and provide active exposure to the following career-related concepts...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Object-Oriented Programming in C/C++</li>
        <li>Building a REST API Web Application using Python, HTML/CSS, XML, and JavaScript</li>
        <li>Contributing to a remote repository from a local development environment</li>
        <li>Database Design</li>
        <li>Network Drivers and Wireless I/O devices</li>
        <li>Real-Time Data Collection and Data Ingestion</li>
        <li>Computer Systems Engineering (CSE) fundamentals</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><u>Motivation</u></h3>

    <p>An IT-relevant hobby is a great way to learn new skills, develop a work portfolio, test new ideas, and connect with like-minded 
    individuals. Modern IOT developers need a basic understanding of sensors, controls, drivers, compilers, UX/UI interfaces, databases, 
    and network design to be effective in their roles. Single board computer design is a fun and affordable hobby that offers significant 
    exposure to these practical IT concepts in the form of entertaining projects and tutorials. Arduino is a company that sells 
    motherboards, sensors, wires, touchscreens, software, and just about any electronic device or computer part that one could imagine. 
    The company offers a tremendous variety of kits, tutorials, modular electronics, and software designed for rapid prototyping of 
    computer-based electronics and robotics equipment. Arduino is popular with engineers and hobbyists alike, and the company has built a 
    solid reputation for providing high-quality modular components and exceptional tutorials.</p>
    
    <h3><u>Project Goals and Assessments</u></h3>
    <p>The project is broken down into weekly sub-goals. Weekly goals and assessment criteria are presented together here, in the list below.

        <li>Complete the final presentation explaining how each section of the project went and share it with GitHub Pages and the rest 
            of the class.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><u>Risks to Completing the Project</u></h3>
    <p>This will be my first Arduino project, so I expect to encounter some technical difficulties along the way. Here are some of the 
        risks to completing the project on time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Broken or missing parts:</strong> Forgetting to purchase a power supply or special component, or needing to replace a 
            broken piece at the wrong time could delay the project timeline by a week or so.</li>
        <li><strong>Running out of memory:</strong> The final device is intended to function as a standalone computer with local and wide 
            area network connectivity. Single board computers contain less memory than a typical computer, however. Running out of 
            on-board memory would require restructuring the code base and rolling development features, either of these outcomes would 
            jeopardize the project timeline and outcome.</li>
        <li><strong>Choosing the right development tools for the job:</strong> It is difficult to know ahead of time every tool that will 
            work best for this project.</li>
        <li><strong>Forgetting a project section:</strong> It is possible that I may have overlooked some critical detail in the project 
            outline. There is also a chance that the project could be significantly more complicated than it is presented to be. Both 
            risks need to be addressed in the project timeline.</li>
        <li><strong>Completing the project in the wrong order:</strong> Performing the development steps in the wrong order could lead to 
            complex bugs involving electrical components. For example, a project task could involve parts or firmware that are incompatible 
            with another section of the project. Troubleshooting a problem such as this could be time-consuming.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><u>Mitigation Strategies</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Broken or Missing Parts:</strong> I have done my best to include only parts mentioned by the tutorials that I encountered 
            when designing this project. After ordering the first round of parts, I estimate that the lead time is somewhere between 5 and 7 
            days. I plan to prevent this sort of delay by organizing a dry run each week and checking the inventory for the next round. This 
            way I can identify any missing or broken parts before it really becomes an issue.</li>
        <li><strong>Running out of memory:</strong> Memory limitations are a real concern in firmware development since there is often limited 
            on-board memory available for storing instructions. To combat this, I will need to use memory efficiently by applying algorithms 
            and deleting memory objects to prevent memory leaks. The good news is that Arduino single board computers should contain enough 
            memory to support most common driver functions. I expect the bigger task will be skimming the data from whatever port the device 
            is communicating on. </li>
        <li><strong>Choosing the right development tools:</strong> I have done my best to outline the tools and resources I plan to use in each 
            stage of the project outline. That said, it is likely that unexpected problems will develop at some point in the project. 
            The important thing is to stay flexible and recognize when a solution is not working as it was once expected. If a tool does not 
            appear to be working, it may be time for a substitution. It is important to remain flexible and consider alternative tools and methods 
            that can assist in moving the project forward.</li>
        <li><strong>Completing project items in the wrong order:</strong> I have afforded myself a 4-week learning period that I can use to 
            reassess the project design and make changes as I identify them. I believe this should provide plenty of time to identify 
            out-of-order project goals. Each step requires a minimum number of new parts and I plan on keeping the number of sensors to a minimum 
            over the course of this project. Each week provides an opportunity to reflect and change course if necessar</li>
    </ul>
