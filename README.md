The aim of this project is to create a system that will monitor my 4X4 grow tent, which currently contains four potted plants and two hydroponic systems, while I am on vacation. The goal is integrate several arduino sensors (e.g., those for temperature, pH, and total dissolved solids, AKA "TDS") using a single-board computer and then stream this data to a laptop or cellular device via a bluetooth or wifi tranceiver module. This project will investigate concepts relevant to the internet of things (IOT), with a focus on real-time data handling and network driver development.
