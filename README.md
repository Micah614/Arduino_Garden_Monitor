The aim of this project is to create a system that will monitor the status of a 4X4 grow tent and a hydroponic system(s). This project will utilize arduino parts and software, including bluetooth and wifi tranceiver modules. 

The goal is to generate, track, and monitor real-time system measurements such as hydroponic solution pH, solution/ambient temperatures, total dissolved solids (TDS), and soil moisture of potted plants.
