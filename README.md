The aim of this project is to create a system that will monitor my 4X4 grow tent, which currently contains four potted plants and two hydroponic systems, while my wife and I are on vacation. The general goal is integrate several arduino sensors (e.g., for temperature, pH, and total dissolved solids, AKA "TDS") with a single-board computer, and stream this data to a laptop or android cellphone using a bluetooth and/or wifi tranceiver module. This project will discuss several concepts of relevance to the internet of things (IOT), with a focus on real-time data handling by exploring wireless networking and network driver development.
