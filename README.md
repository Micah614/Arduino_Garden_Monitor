The aim of this project is to create a system to monitor my 4X4 grow tent, which currently contains four potted plants and two hydroponic systems. The general goal is integrate several arduino sensors (e.g., for temperature, pH, and total dissolved solids, AKA "TDS") with a single-board computer, and stream this data to a laptop or android cellphone using a bluetooth and/or wifi tranceiver module.

This project will discuss several concepts of relevance to the internet of things (IOT). This project will focus on real-time data handling, wireless networking, and network driver development.
