Title: Arduino Indoor Weather Station 

The aim of this project is to create a system to monitor my 4X4 grow tent (which currently contains four potted plants and two hydroponic systems) while I am away on vacation. The goal is integrate several arduino sensors (e.g., those for temperature, pH, and total dissolved solids, AKA "TDS") on a single-board computer and stream this data to a laptop or cellular device via bluetooth or wifi tranceiver module(s). This project will investigate concepts relevant to the internet of things (IOT), with a focus on real-time data handling and network driver development.

<strong>Vision Statement:</strong> My goals for this project are: 1.) Learn the basics of hardware monitoring and control. 2.) Develop hands-on experience with IOT networks and application-driven devices. 3.) Gain experience with object oriented programming in C++; device integration and server programming in Python. 3.) Extend my knowledge of XHTML data formatting and web-development using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 

<strong>Motivation:</strong> My motivation for completing this project is to begin a long-term research and development project relevant to my hobbies and interests. My hope is that by orienting a portfolio around my personal interests, I will be more likely to continue this project and develop a portfolio of professional skills in the future.

<strong>Project Goal:</strong> 1.) Assemble an Arduino device to monitor the pH, TDS, temperature, humidity, etc. of my 4x4 indoor garden. 2.) Monitor live-stream data generated by these devices on my laptop computer or cell phone. 

<strong>Risks:</strong> This project requires Arduino hardware components (many of which I have already ordered) as well as some technical background about analytical sensors and network devices, supported by my previous occupation and prior studies of the CompTIA Network+ Study Guide, respectively.

<strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> In addition to the sensors, wires, and board components needed to make the pH transceiver device, I have purchased an Arduino "Project Board" that comes with a highly-recommended tutorial outlining many beginner to intermediate level Arduino projects. There are also many YouTube tutorials on how to create a pH meter using Arduino components, how to create an Arduino network device, and more that I can use to further my progress.

<strong>Project Assessments:</strong> The end goal is to spin up a simple xhtml webpage that shows real-time measurements collected from my Arduino project within the last c.a. 20 minutes or so. That way, I can check on my plants anywhere there is an internet connection.
