Title: Arduino Indoor Weather Station 

The aim of this project is to create a system to monitor my 4X4 grow tent (which currently contains four potted plants and two hydroponic systems) while I am away on vacation. The goal is integrate several arduino sensors (e.g., those for temperature, pH, and total dissolved solids, AKA "TDS") using a single-board computer and then stream this data to a laptop or cellular device via a bluetooth or wifi tranceiver module. This project will investigate concepts relevant to the internet of things (IOT), with a focus on real-time data handling and network driver development.

<strong>Vision Statement:</strong> My goal for this project is to learn more about hardware monitoring and control, as well as to learn a bit more about networks and application development. 

<strong>Motivation:</strong> My motivation for completing this project is to begin a long-term development project that is relevant to my interests and hobbies. By orienting a portfolio around my personal hobbies, my hope is that I will continue adding to this development project for a long time, helping to strengthening my skills as a developer and adding some complementary job skills and teaching me complementary job skills that I can confidently add to my resume. 

<strong>Project Goal:</strong> Assemble an Arduino device to monitor the pH of my hydroponics system and collect/monitor live-stream data collected from this device on my laptop computer or cell phone. 

<strong>Risks:</strong> This project requires multiple hardware components (Arduino kit components, which I have already ordered) and some technical background regarding analytical sensors and network devices.

<strong>Mitigation Strategies:</strong> In addition to the sensors, wires, and board components needed to make the pH transceiver device, I have purchased an Arduino "Project Board" that comes with a highly-recommended tutorial outlining many beginner to intermediate level Arduino projects. There are also many YouTube tutorials on how to create a pH meter using Arduino components, how to create an Arduino network device, and more that I can use to further my progress.

<strong>Project Assessments:</strong> The end goal is to spin up a simple xhtml webpage that shows real-time measurements collected from my Arduino project within the last c.a. 20 minutes or so. That way, I can check on my plants anywhere there is an internet connection.
