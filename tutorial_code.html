    <h1>Arduino Tutorials</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Arduino mini-project and tutorials page. This page will contain information, images, and raw code from the Arduino 
        (C/C++) firmware development projects. This page contains firmware source code in C/C++, as well as project images and videos 
        describing my outcomes and observations from completing the project tutorials that came with my Freenove Projects Board. This page 
        describes my process in acquiring the skills that I will need to complete the larger project involving wireless network connected
        IOT devices and RESTful API development. 

        Each entry of this page describes an experiment involving single board computer parts and C++ driver software, including sensors, 
        switches, game buttons, joy sticks, LEDs, continuous control knobs, RFID field detector, serial and wireless network I/O adapters, 
        and anything else that I may have at my disposal. Some of these projects are from the tutorial guide, others are designed by me. 
        Be sure to check out the <a href="" class="">WiFi Connected Greenhouse Monitor and RESTful API Project</a> for more cool new 
        Arduino madness. </p>
