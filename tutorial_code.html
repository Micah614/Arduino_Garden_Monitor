    <h1>Arduino Tutorials</h1>
    <!--Page Summary-->
    <p>Welcome to the Arduino mini-project and tutorial page. This web page contains summaries including images, data, and source code 
        snippets from the Arduino (C++) firmware development tutorials. This URL includes firmware source code as well as project images 
        and videos describing outcomes and observations of completing Arduino project tutorials that came with my Freenove Projects Board. 
        This page describes my process in acquiring the skills that I will need to complete the larger project involving wireless network 
        connected IOT devices and REST API development. 

        Each entry in this table below describes an experiment involving single board computer parts and C++ driver software, including sensors, 
        switches, game buttons, joy sticks, LEDs, continuous control knobs, RFID field detector, serial and wireless network I/O adapters, 
        and anything else that I may have at my disposal. Some of these projects are from the tutorial guide, others are designed by me. 
        Be sure to check out the <a href="./greenhouse_monitor_project.html" class="">WiFi Connected Greenhouse Monitor and RESTful API Project</a> for more cool new 
        Arduino madness. </p>

        <p>
            A large part of week two was spent completing the project proposal and developing the project 
            timeline, but I did manage to squeeze in a few tutorials as well. 
            
            The early chapters of the tutorial start by explaining the basics of the Arduino integrated 
            development environment (IDE), and how to create, compile, push and test C/C++ device firmware. 
            This tutorial explain the basic concepts of driver functions, including the roles of the setup() 
            and loop() driver methods and various system calls that can be used to control and communicate 
            with various circuit components. 
            
            The Arduino IDE software is an incredibly durable, intuitive, robust and reliable development 
            platform, in my opinion. The window pane layout of the Arduino IDE tool makes the purpose of 
            each tool clear to the user and using each tool is remarkably straight-forward. Simply download 
            the software on the Arduino website, and set up a folder for sketch files. The only downside that 
            I did encounter was the incompatibility of the Arduino IDE with GitHub repository monitored files.
            Apparently the GitHub environment space is too large and/or complex for the Arduino IDE to 
            interpret and work with. 
            
            Although the IDE does not require many dependencies to install, the resulting sketch files 
            create a fairly large number of dependencies, with a ratio somewhere in the range of 2-3 
            additional files for every new sketch file that is created. The IDE software comes with its' 
            own shell terminal, file manager, and text editor. Presumably at least some of these 
            dependency files contain information required by one or more of the IDE software components.  
            
            Programming in the Arduino IDE involves a mixture of C/C++ object-oriented programming, syscalls, 
            and Arduino-defined function stems (e.g., "setup()" and "loop()"). Developers are free to define 
            helper functions of any kind, subject only to the memory constraints of the single-board 
            computer the firmware is loaded on. 
            
            Week 2's tutorial material primarily discussed the manner data is sent and received across a 
            serial communication port, including communicating with a device by submitting instructions through 
            a terminal.
            Later this semester I will extract very similar time-series information from a system of my own design 
            and use it to investigate a variety of "extract-transform-load" (ETL) and "extract-load-transform" 
            (ELT) methods, including SQL based data storage, XML and JSON file formats.
