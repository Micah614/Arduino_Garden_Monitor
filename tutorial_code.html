    <!--Page Summary-->
    <p>
        Welcome to the Arduino mini-project and tutorial page. 
        
        This page includes tutorial documentation with photos, data, and Arduino source code. Each tutorial 
        section described in the summaries below describes skills and knowledge that was acquired to 
        complete the larger project of building an IOT-integrated device and REST API platform at a URL 
        related at this website. 

        Each entry in this table below outlines an experiment or observation involving single board computer 
        parts and Arduino packaged firmware. Working materials include sensors, switches, buttons, LEDs, 
        continuous control knobs, joystick, and RFID field detector, to name a few. Some of these projects are 
        from the tutorial guide, others might be designed by me. Check out the

            Week 1+2: Start a GitHub Pages Website, Start Tutorial, Develop and Submit a Proposal
        </h4>
        <p>
            A large part of week 1+2 was spent developing the project proposal and crafting a project timeline. 
            Early chapters of the project board tutorial (completed in week 2) explain the basics of the Arduino 
            integrated development environment (IDE), as well as how to create, compile, push and test Arduino 
            firmware.

            The project board tutorial explains the basic concepts of driver functions, including the roles of 
            the setup() and loop() driver methods and how to use system calls to control and communicate with 
            prototype electronics via comm. hubs, electrical circuits, and free-range communication exchange 
            media (e.g., infrared, RFID, etc.).
            
            The Arduino IDE software provides a feature rich and intuitive development platform. The set up 
            involves a simple download from the official Arduino website, and choosing a folder to contain future 
            source files. The only pitfall that I encountered during this set up was an apparent incompatibility 
            of Arduino IDE generated files and the GitHub repository stored on my local computer. According to 
            the generated error messages, the GitHub repository on my local computer creates an environment that 
            is too complex for the Arduino IDE to interact with. While investigating this finding, I observed 
            that each sketch (another term for an Arduino source file) generates a number of dependency files 
            during compile time, producing a "bloat ratio" in the range of 2-3 new files for each new sketch. 
            GitHub compatiblity issues aside, the IDE software provides a great list of features including a 
            file manager, terminal shell, and editor.
            
            Programming in the Arduino dialect of C++ involves a mixture of object-oriented programming, 
            development of sys- and trap- calls, and tactful use of Arduino-defined function stems, including 
            "setup()", "loop()", and "digitalWrite()". Arduino developers are free to define helper functions of 
            any kind, subject only to the hardware constraints of the single-board the firmware is loaded on.

            Chapter 1: LED Blink
        </h5>
        <p>
            Chapter one of this tutorial explains the concept of converting analog to digital signals. The 
            chapter describes the LED circuit and the role of the "setup()", "loop()", "delay()" and 
            "digitalWrite()" functions in firmware. Each of these principles is demostrated through a 
            firmware program designed to drive a blinking LED. <br> <br>
            
            <b>Sketch: LED_Blink</b> <br> <br> 
            // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board <br> 
            void setup() { <br> 
              // initialize digital pin 13 as an output <br> 
              pinMode(13, OUTPUT); <br> 
            } <br> 
            // the loop function runs over and over again forever <br> 
            void loop() { <br> 
              digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) <br> 
              delay(1000); // wait for a second <br> 
              digitalWrite(13, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW <br> 
              delay(1000); // wait for a second <br> 
            } <br>

            Chapter 2: Flowing LED
        </h5>
        <p>
            Chapter 2 of this material demonstrates the object-oriented nature of firmware development by explaining the basic 
            loops and data structures (i.e., arrays) needed to synchronize and control devices on electronic circuits, in this case, a 
            sequence of LEDs on the Freenove project board. <br> <br>

            Chapter 3: Control LED with a Push Button Switch
        </h5>
        <p>
            Chapter 3 of this tutorial explains the circuit fundamentals of controlling circuit behavior with a 
            button-based switch.

            <strong>Figure 3.)</strong> Control state of the project board. (IDE). <br> <br> 

            The first sub-section of this chapter discusses how the voltage state of the circuit in figure 3 
            can be encoded as a meaningful signal state by applying the firmware to the control board set to 
            the configuration shown in figure 3. <br> 

            <img src="./Images/Control_LED_by_Button.jpg"> <br>

            The second sketch design maintains the "ON" or "OFF" state of the LED subcircuit until the button 
            is pressed again. This is commonly referred to as programming a "persistant state" in the controller. 
            Included in the circuit knowledge of this chapter is a discussion about controlling "bounce" in 
            electrical cicuits. Bounce is a phenomena created by micro-imbalances in the electrical signal prior 
            to achieving a maintainable state. Controlling bounce essentially involves inoking a delay prior to 
            the interpretation of an electrical state signal. If bounce is left uncontrolled by the device 
            firmware, the state of the controlling device (i.e., button) is read during a period of oscillation, 
            causing the firmware to react rapidly to the perceived ON/OFF state detected in the circuit. <br> <br> 

            We can see how this sleep()-like system call is applied in the driver firmware by reading the sketch 
            code snippet below. <br> <br>

            Chapter 4: Sending/Receiving Data Through a Serial Communication Port (AKA "Comm. Port")
        </h5>
        <p>
            Chapter 4 discusses the basics of serial (AKA "Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)") protocol, in which 
            two communicating devices claim designated transmitting and receiving ports used to communicate with another device or 
            intercept signals on a network it connects with. The code knowledge of this section explains the role of interruption 
            programs (AKA "system calls") in collecting asynchronous feedback from connected or communicating devices. This 
            block quote from the tutorial provides a good analogy for the subject: <br> 
            <blockquote>
                ...suppose you're watching TV while there is water heating in your kitchen... (without a teakettle spout) you have to 
                check whether the water is boiling or not from time to time, so you can't concentrate on watching TV. But (with) an 
                interrupt, things are different. Interrupts work much like the lid on your teakettle, ... it whistles when the water is 
                beginning to boil ... so you can focus on watching TV ..."
            </blockquote>
            The role of the interrupt program is to allow the processor to facilitate the execution of as many tasks (or programs) as 
            possible while conserving computational resources.

            Chapter 5 - Analog-to-Digital Converters ("ADC"s) in Serial Communication
        </h5>
        <p>
            ADC is used to convert analog (the physical signal) signals into digital signals (the abstract 
            message being transmitted between electronic devices). This section of the tutorial 
            explains how this signal transformation is achieved.
        </p>

        <h5>
            Circuit Knowledge
        </h5>        
        <p> 
            An ADC is an electronic circuit used to convert analog signals such as voltage to 
            digital or binary format consisting of 0's and 1's. The range of the ADC module included in the 
            project board is 10 bits, which means the ADC circuit component carries a 2^10 = 1024 bit 
            resolution. This means that the ADC's voltage settings are evenly and reliably distributed into 
            1024 "discrete" voltages (ranging from 0 to 5V), each corresponding to a digital signal. 
        </p>
        <img src="./Images/ADC_Graph.png">
        <p>
            <strong>Figure 2.)</strong> A graphical explaination of the potentiometer-driven analog-to-digital 
            converter, also known as "ADC", principles. The rotational potentiometer included in the project board 
            achieves 1024 unique states, each equating to a unique binary/digital output. Note the step-like 
            behavior of this function, revealing the discretized voltage ranges corresponding to each digital 
            output.
        </p>
        <p>
            This voltage setting is controlled with a circuit element called a "potentiometer", which is 
            essentially an adjustable resistor element. Potentiometers are typically controlled by a resistive 
            substance (e.g., a wire or a carbon element) and a contact brush. The resistance (and therefore 
            voltage) of the potentiometer changes depending on the placement of the contact brush. The position 
            of this contact brush is what provides the ADC with it's resolution capacity. The resistive surface 
            is divided into discrete stages for the contact brush to rest upon. It is the position of this brush 
            that effects the analog to digital signal transformation and determines the ADC's signal resolution.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The potentiometer is the core electrical component of a turn dial knob, such as one might find in 
            an old car radio. In fact, these turn dials are sometimes called "rotary potentiometers", since they 
            really just linear potentiometers with the physical action mapped to a rotational range of 
            motion. Because each voltage must be mapped to a discrete digital signal, a calculation must be 
            included in the driver code to complete the analog-to-digital signal transformation. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>Experiment/Sketch:</h4>
        <p>
            This tutorial section demonstrates the core concepts of ADC by writing a program to read the 
            current voltage of a rotary potentiometer and send this data to the IDE Serial Monitor window 
            via a serial port connection (port 4, in this case). The following section is driver code 
            collected from the tutorial.
