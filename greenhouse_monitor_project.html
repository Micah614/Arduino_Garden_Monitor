            Week 6: Breadboard Wiring, Part Replacements, and Discovering Microservice Architecture Patterns. 
        </h4>
        <p>
            Week 6 was mainly spent assembling the Greenhouse monitor breadboard and ordering an 
            alternative ESP8266 microcontroller to convert the greenhouse monitor into a web server with its' 
            own IP address. I also begain exploring microservice architectures with the help of a Udemy course 
            called <cite>"Build, deploy, and scale an E-Commerce app using Microservices built with Node, React, 
            Docker and Kubernetes"</cite>. This lecture series has pointed out key differences between microservice 
            and monolithic software patterns, and I try my best to develop the API according to these patterns, with 
            the hope of extending the application using Node JS, React, or a different framework at a later time.

            My current architectural design idea is to write a driver program to "harvest" sensor 
            data at regular intervals and present it on a serial bus where the messages can be read by the 
            the recieving portion of the same driver firmware and diverted to a SQL transaction database,
            transforming the real-time sensor data into an aggregate measurement, and asynchronously populate 
            an OLAP data warehouse file (all located on same serial bus) and used this aggregated offline data 
            to satisfy server GET/POST requests.
            
            I believe I can present this summarized data using a single-page web application (REACT?) and embedd the information


            that I can program to collect and serve to users in the form of XHTML or JSON, whenever an update 
            is detected in the offline database. The resulting single-page web API that can then very easily 
            be linked or embedded into this website for final demonstration purposes.

            Assembling, Calibrating, and Testing the pH Meter Function
        </h5>
        <p>
            I tracked down the following tutorial mentioning some of the parts I have on hand: 
            <cite><a href="https://www.electroniclinic.com/ph-meter-arduino-ph-meter-calibration-diymore-ph-sensor-arduino-code/" target="blank">
            "pH meter Arduino, pH Meter Calibration, DIYMORE pH Sensor Arduino Code"</a></cite>. I decided 
            to wire the positive and terminal leads to the breadboard in preparation for the serial hub 
            integration that will come later in the project. Here is another article that came in handy:
            <a href="https://cdn.awsli.com.br/969/969921/arquivos/ph-sensor-ph-4502c.pdf" target="blank">pH probe</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            After I placed the connections and verified a response from the pH sensor, I lined out a calibration curve 
            using vinegar and milk as stand-in calibration solutions (real calibration solutions are on the way). The 
            result is a remarkably stable and robust pH meter, which I have been using to monitor and adjust the solutions 
            in both hydroponic systems. The program currently sends updates to a serial monitor on my laptop at a rate of 2 Hz.

            Success!! A Working pH Meter and Thermocouple.
        </h5>
        <img src="./Images/pH_meter_thermometer.jpg">

        <p>
            One of the most exciting moments this week was getting the drivers for the pH meter and 
            thermocouple up and running. Since I didn't have any real calibrating solutions on hand I decided 
            to calibrate the pH probe using milk and vinegar. As awful as this sounds, the attempt went very 
            well and I managed to produce some fairly accurate values in the serial monitor window.The 
            current driver code is shown below.
