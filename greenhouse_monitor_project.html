            Week 6 was spent assembling the Greenhouse monitor breadboard and circuit boards, as well as 
            ordering an alternative ESP8266 microcontroller to convert the greenhouse monitor unit into a 
            standalone web server. I also begain exploring microservice architectures with the help of a 
            Udemy course called <cite>"Build, deploy, and scale an E-Commerce app using Microservices built 
            with Node, React, Docker and Kubernetes"</cite>. This lecture series pointed out several microservice
            patterns that can be implemented in Node JS and React that might be useful in designing the 
            REST API. This lecture series contains 54.5 hours of lecture material in total, and I will 
            most likely refer to it time and again over the course of the project.

            Figure 1.) Basic Arduino Breadboard circuit pinout diagram. The top and bottom power rails (red) 
            are divided into 3.3V and 5V power supply sections. Ground rails are shown in blue and can be used 
            by any circuit component requiring a ground. The center (green) pinout locations are reserved for 
            circuit components, and for our intents and purposes acts as a serial communication hub.
