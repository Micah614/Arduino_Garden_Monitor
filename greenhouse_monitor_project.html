            Week 6: Breadboard Wiring, Part Replacements, and Uncovering Microservice Architecture Patterns. 
        </h4>
        <p>
            Week 6 was largely spent assembling the Greenhouse monitor breadboard and ordering an 
            alternative ESP8266 microcontroller to convert the greenhouse monitor unit into a 
            standalone web server. I also begain exploring microservice architectures with the help of a 
            Udemy course called <cite>"Build, deploy, and scale an E-Commerce app using Microservices built 
            with Node, React, Docker and Kubernetes"</cite>. This lecture series has pointed out several 
            microservice architecture patterns that I may be able to implement using Node JS and React after 
            the server and meter components have bee tested. 

            My current architectural design idea is to write a driver program for the integrated sensor 
            circuit that will collect data at scheduled intervals (and for a specified time interval) 
            and send this sensor information over to the serial bus, where the messages will be collected and 
            transformed by the driver program into a sequence of time-series SQLite data tuples, routed into 
            a "raw" data table. (Note: preferably this database will be located on the server itself, however 
            cloud-based storage is another option that I will investigate). I can then develop an SQLite trigger 
            to aggregate raw data and enter it into a separate offline database (i.e., a data warehouse), where 
            a React single-page web application can collect and serve the data to users in the form of XHTML
            and/or JSON. The resulting single-page web API that can be linked with or embedded into this 
            website for demonstration purposes.

            are divided into 3.3V and 5V power supply sections. Ground rails are shown in blue and can be used 
            by any circuit component requiring a ground. The center (green) pinout locations are reserved for 
            circuit components, and for our intents and purposes acts as a serial communication hub.
