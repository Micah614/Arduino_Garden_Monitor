            Week 6: Breadboard Wiring, Part Replacements, and Discovering Microservice Architecture Patterns. 
        </h4>
        <p>
            Week 6 was mainly spent assembling the Greenhouse monitor breadboard circuit and investigating architecture 
            patters to use with my ESP8266 transceiver module. I begain exploring microservice architectures with 
            the help of a Udemy course: <cite>"Build, deploy, and scale an E-Commerce app using Microservices built 
            with Node, React, Docker and Kubernetes"</cite>. This lecture series pointed out key differences between 
            microservice and monolithic architecture, and my aim is to develop the API accordance with these microservice 
            patterns, in the hope of extending this application in the future using Node JS, React, or a different framework.

            My current architectural design idea is to write a driver program that will "harvest" sensor 
            data at regular intervals and present this raw data to the serial bus where the messages can be read by the the 
            recieving portion of the driver firmware and inserted as a well-constructed tuple into a SQL transaction database,
            then transform this raw sensor data into an aggregate measurement and populate an OLAP style data warehouse file 
            via a trigger in order to satisfy the server GET and/or POST requests. I am hoping that further research into REST 
            API architecture involving arduino sensors will offer further clarity.

            Breadboard Basics

            <strong>Figure 1.)</strong> Basic Arduino Breadboard circuit pinout diagram. The top and bottom power rails (red) 
            are divided into 3.3V and 5V power supply sections. Ground rails are shown in blue and can be used 
            by any circuit component requiring a ground. The center (green) pinout locations are reserved for 
            circuit components, and for our intents and purposes acts as a serial communication hub.

        <h5>
            Assembling, Calibrating, and Testing the pH Meter Function
        </h5>
        <p>
            First, I tracked down the following tutorial mentioning some of the parts I have on hand: 
            <cite><a href="https://www.electroniclinic.com/ph-meter-arduino-ph-meter-calibration-diymore-ph-sensor-arduino-code/" target="blank">
            "pH meter Arduino, pH Meter Calibration, DIYMORE pH Sensor Arduino Code"</a></cite>. I decided 
            to wire the positive and terminal leads to the breadboard in preparation for the serial hub 
            integration that will come later in the project. Here is another article that came in handy:
            <a href="https://cdn.awsli.com.br/969/969921/arquivos/ph-sensor-ph-4502c.pdf" target="blank">pH probe</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I placed the connections and verified a response from the pH sensor, I lined out a calibration curve 
            using vinegar and milk as my stand-in calibration solutions (real calibration solutions are on the way) and applied
            a short circuit connection to the pH probe terminal to register a neutral (i.e., pH = 7) response from the pH 
            probe. The result is a remarkably stable and robust pH meter, and I have been using it to monitor and adjust the pH of 
            the nutrient solutions in both of my hydroponic systems! The program I currently have relays updates to the IDE serial monitor 
            at a rate of around 2 Hz (2 updates/second). I also have a working driver sketch for the temperature probe, and I plan on 
            combined these two programs, along with others in the final version of the driver sketch program.
        </p>

            Success!! A Working pH Meter and Thermocouple.

        <img src="./Images/pH_meter_thermometer.jpg">

        <p>
            <strong>Figure 2.)</strong> One of the most exciting moments this week was getting the drivers for the pH meter and thermocouple up and running. Since 
            I don't have any real calibrating solutions on hand at the moment, I decided to calibrate the pH probe using milk and 
            vinegar. As awful as that sounds, the attempt went well and I managed to produce some surprisingly accurate values when 
            I tested it with an off-curve calibration standard (pH=6.86).

            Week 7: Integrating Sensors and Formatting the Serial Monitor Output
        </h4>
        <p>
            During <a href="#week_7">Week 7</a> I was able to combine drivers for pH, temperature and 
            total dissolved solids (TDS) and collect streaming measurements from all three instruments at 
            once in the serial monitor. I learned about baud rate synchronization this week when I discovered
            that Arduino TDS sensors typically operate at a 115200 baud rate frequency, which is 12 times higher 
            than the pH or temperature probes typically operate. I managed to compensate for these differences 
            in communication rates by modifying the TDS to operate at a 9600 baud rate, at the cost of some 
            additional start-up time owing to the increased buffer time needed to collect TDS sensor measurements.

            <strong>Figure 5.)</strong> Serial monitor output displaying an initial measurement of the TDS probe after 
            equilibration. This nutrient solution was replaced about 2 days ago, so this is TDS measurement should represent a nice baseline. 
            The pH measurement is from 2-day old 6.86 pH buffer solution. The water from my refrigerator registers at 180ppm (TDS units) on this device.
        </p>

        <p>
            An electromagnetic interference appears to occur in the pH probe whenever it is held in the same nutrient solution as the TDS sensor. 
            This happens because of the way each meter performs its' task. TDS operates on a principle that is sometimes referred to as "amperage-driven 
            voltage detection". Essentially, the TDS meter tests the conductivity of the solution by emitting tiny pulses of electric current and reading 
            the voltage accross the anode/cathode gap. The pH probe uses the principle of passive voltage detection to measure the relative concentration 
            of cations (i.e., H+) and anions (i.e., OH-) in the solution. Placing the pH and TDS meters in the same solution causes the pH probe to act 
            erratically, due to the percieved abundance of negative charge released by the cathode of the TDS sensor. This excess current registers in the 
            pH meters' passive voltage scale as an abundance of anions in solution, causing it to report a falsely elevated pH. 
        </p>

        <p>            
            Given this observation it appears reasonable to assume that maintaining the pH and TDS probes on seperate Baud frequencies could 
            offset the effect of this interference. After testing this hypothesis, I concluded that the pH and TDS meter can share no more than two of the 
            following three testing conditions with each other: {baud_rate, test_solution, time_period}. Running the sensors on different baud rates 
            is not an option, because the serial monitor can maintain only one Baud rate frequency at a time. Making time-scale decoupling the only option for 
            creating a stand-alone measurement system with all three sensors. 


        </p>
        <p>
            Since I maintain both of my hydroponic systems identically, the measurements these systems produce may be considered equivalent within a negligible margin 
            of error (i.e., less than 10%). Given this fact, I have decided to temporarily resolve this system timing issue by placing the TDS sensor in the other 
            system reservior, which should provide a reasonable "best of both worlds" solution at the cost of staking the accuracy of these measurements on the precision 
            of my solution preps.
        </p>    
        <p>
            This should provide a relatively accurate estimate of system pH and TDS measurements in each unit, while allowing the pH and TDS sensors to remain 
            online and operate simultaneously. I plan to revisit this issue of time-scale decoupling once the online API, dashboard, and database have been 
            developed.

            <strong>Figure 6.)</strong> Week 8 was spent finding the "perfect" API framework for the Arduino REST API Monitor. After searching for 
            "ESP-8266 API architectures" and narrowing the results to match the model of my ESP-8266 transceiver chip, I found a 
            set of articles about Ardunio ESP-8266 and Firebase IOT web app development package. The Firebase system provides 
            a series of "node module" template classes that can be used to construct various microservice-based web, mobile, 
            and IOT applications. The Firebase system is renowned for the relative ease with which developers can expand their 
            applications using microservices. The Firebase system is a very complex system of libraries containing common architectural 
            design choices and a suite of development tools. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The process of learning to use Firebase has so far involved downloading multiple libraries (including node modules) into a subfolder of my project repository
            using Unix terminal shell commands. Finding these articles required a solid 3 or 4 hours of research, perhaps evenly divided betweeen the time spent searching 
            for online articles, eliminating the bad ones, and working through the ones I could use. Due to this unexpected time expenditure, I have not made any 
            substantiative changes to the device or API this week. Instead, the majority of this week's efforts was dedicated to project planning.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Status:</strong> I am currently bookmarked about halfway through the second article, pausing briefly to digest the first half of the tutorial series: <cite>"ESP8266 NodeMCU: Getting Started with Firebase (Realtime Database)"
            </cite>, a document that I did not uncover until reading most of the second article: <cite>"ESP8266 NodeMCU with Firebase – Creating a Web App"</cite>, which 
            I will need to complete to integrate the ESP-8266 with the greenhouse monitor.

            Week 9: Exploring Arduino ESP-8266 (12E), Google Firebase, and PlatformIO
        </h4>
        <p>
            Week 9 was dedicated to the investigation of cloud-based API services, Arduino ESP-8266 WiFi hardware and sketch libraries (e.g., SoftwareSerial, NodeJS, 
            NodeMCU, etc.), Google Firebase (live database API resource), and a new VSCode IDE platform for managing Arduino projects called "PlatformIO".
        </p>

        <img src="./Images/ESP8266_Realtime_DB.png">
        <p>
            <strong>Figure 7.)</strong> The most recent objective of the Greenhouse Monitor REST API project involves establishing a database connection with the ESP-8266 (12E) Wifi 
            tranceiver to push data to a cloud based API resource that can be read by (e.g.) REACT Hooks at a later stage of the project. Completing this stage of the 
            project will involve establishing a TX/RX-based serial connection between the Arduino Uno and the ESP-8266 Wifi device.  
        </p>

        <h5>
            Google Firebase, PlatformIO, and ESP-8266 (12E) WiFi Libraries
        </h5>
        <p>
            <i>
                The tutorials that I lined out last week turned out to be helpful, just not in the way I thought they would be.
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The tutorials I found for connecting the ESP-8266 to a live database hosted by the Google Firebase platform were not as straightforward as they first appeared. 
            After a few honest attempts at reproducing thier source code and device configuration, I realized that this stage of the project would not be as simple as 
            following a few simple tutorials. The tutorials did turn out to be useful for highlighting several of the missing tools in my current Arduinio IOT arsenal, 
            leading to progress in the development of the WiFi Greenhouse Monitor REST API Project. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The first benefit I derived from these tutorials was an past-due introduction to an IDE system called PlatformIO. PlatformIO is a tool suit that enables 
            IOT application developers to organize sketches within a platform-independent environment and apply version control using Git. The package suite offers 
            numerous other tools; including gcc and g++ compilers, linters, board managers, library managers, GitHub extensions, unit testing frameworks, and a whole 
            lot more. Andriod, IOT, and IOS developers use PlatformIO to organize projects, fulfill software licensing standards, and prepare thier applications for production. 
            I like how easy it is to set up project folders, load project-specific library resources, test hardware connections, and handle version control using GitHub. 
            Although the interface is very different, everything that can be found in the Official Arduino IDE can be found in PlatformIO. 
        </p>

        <img src="./Images/PlatformIO.png">
        <p>
            <strong>Figure 8.)</strong> Snapshot of the PlatformIO developer toolkit inside a VSCode IDE. PlatformIO hosts a full suite of developer tools for IOT, Andriod, and IOS projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            The downsides of PlatformIO include its' relatively large project folder sizes and a less-than-intuitive file management system that can really eat up memory 
            if care is not taken when creating new projects and/or sketches. PlatformIO has a sophisticated toolset that is perhaps better suited to the professional 
            developer than the ameteur hobbyist. One might say that relative ease of project creation in PlatformIO comes at the expense of a somewhat more 
            complicated file management system for handling the resulting files. Thus, moving forward, I will prefer to use the Arduino IDE for rough sketches and 
            PlatformIO for developing the subsequent, stable software. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The second thing I learned, was how to create a free, live-stream database resource for the REST API. Firebase offers a tier of free-service that offers 
            tools that I can use to host a set of cloud-based sensor variables that should be relatively easy to pull in with a REACT hook. Unfortunately, I was unable 
            to establish a true database connection with the ESP-8266 this week, as my time was spent downloading drivers and libraries, setting up external resources, 
            investigating prospective server architectures, etc. Right now, I have the ESP-8266 chip loaded with a sketch that instructs it to monitor its' D2 and D3 
            pins for GPIOS events being broadcast on COM8 serial monitor by the Ardunino Uno (i.e., the sensor data that we want to relocate to the cloud).
            
            This assists with next step 
            of the project: creating an API resource page with REACT and NodeJS. Essentially, this database resource waits for the ESP-8266 Wifi tranceiver to transmit data that it will collect from the TX/RX ports of the Arduino Uno that was 
            integrated with the analytical probe circuits in <a href="#week_7">week 7</a>
        </p>

            endpoint. The data hosted at this URI can be encorporated into a REACT hook, in order to display the realtime sensor data as an HTML-DOM object. 
        </p>

            <strong>Figure 10.)</strong> Photo of the USB serial connections used to program the Arduino Uno and ESP-8266 (12E) singleboard computers. Provided with the correct sketch and an 
            uninterrupted power-supply, each of these devices will operate under stand-alone conditions, with little to no external computing resources required to 
            drive the system. The Uno is running on COM8, while the ESP-8266 is running on COM9. Both boards are programmed using USB serial connections to my local 
            laptop.
        </p>

        <p>
            The other major breakthroughs this week included loading the drivers and establishing an initial LAN WiFi connection with the ESP-8266 tranceiver. The 
            primary obstacle in getting data exported to the cloud this week was establishing a serial connection between the Uno and ESP-8266. After investigating 
            a LOT of tutorials on ESP-8266 (again, 12E), I realized that the Uno is built with a set of serial broadcast pins (labeled "TX"/"RX") that I should be able 
            to use to send data from the Uno circuit to my ESP-8266, where the data can be repackaged and uploaded to the realtime database.

        <h5>Week 9 Reflection</h5>
        <p>
            Week 9 showed me that the complexity of this REST API project should not be underestimated. My first goal for week 10 will be to collect, format, and 
            transfer data the packets containing the sensor information from the Uno to the ESP-8266 and verify this transmission using the serial monitor on COM9. 
            After this, I will most likely be studying JSON transfer protocols to format the data for transmission to the realtime database. I expect this to be 
            somewhat of a steep learning curve, given my relative unfamiliarity with JSON-based data systems.
