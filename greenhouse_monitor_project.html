            Week 6: Breadboard Wiring, Part Replacements, and Discovering Microservice Architecture Patterns. 
        </h4>
        <p>
            Week 6 was mainly spent assembling the Greenhouse monitor breadboard circuit and investigating architecture 
            patters to use with my ESP8266 transceiver module. I begain exploring microservice architectures with 
            the help of a Udemy course: <cite>"Build, deploy, and scale an E-Commerce app using Microservices built 
            with Node, React, Docker and Kubernetes"</cite>. This lecture series pointed out key differences between 
            microservice and monolithic architecture, and my aim is to develop the API accordance with these microservice 
            patterns, in the hope of extending this application in the future using Node JS, React, or a different framework.

            My current architectural design idea is to write a driver program that will "harvest" sensor 
            data at regular intervals and present this raw data to the serial bus where the messages can be read by the the 
            recieving portion of the driver firmware and inserted as a well-constructed tuple into a SQL transaction database,
            then transform this raw sensor data into an aggregate measurement and populate an OLAP style data warehouse file 
            via a trigger in order to satisfy the server GET and/or POST requests. I am hoping that further research into REST 
            API architecture involving arduino sensors will offer further clarity.

            are divided into 3.3V and 5V power supply sections. Ground rails are shown in blue and can be used 
            by any circuit component requiring a ground. The center (green) pinout locations are reserved for 
            circuit components, and for our intents and purposes acts as a serial communication hub.

        <h5>
            Assembling, Calibrating, and Testing the pH Meter Function
        </h5>
        <p>
            First, I tracked down the following tutorial mentioning some of the parts I have on hand: 
            <cite><a href="https://www.electroniclinic.com/ph-meter-arduino-ph-meter-calibration-diymore-ph-sensor-arduino-code/" target="blank">
            "pH meter Arduino, pH Meter Calibration, DIYMORE pH Sensor Arduino Code"</a></cite>. I decided 
            to wire the positive and terminal leads to the breadboard in preparation for the serial hub 
            integration that will come later in the project. Here is another article that came in handy:
            <a href="https://cdn.awsli.com.br/969/969921/arquivos/ph-sensor-ph-4502c.pdf" target="blank">pH probe</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I placed the connections and verified a response from the pH sensor, I lined out a calibration curve 
            using vinegar and milk as my stand-in calibration solutions (real calibration solutions are on the way) and applied
            a short circuit connection to the pH probe terminal to register a neutral (i.e., pH = 7) response from the pH 
            probe. The result is a remarkably stable and robust pH meter, and I have been using it to monitor and adjust the pH of 
            the nutrient solutions in both of my hydroponic systems! The program I currently have relays updates to the IDE serial monitor 
            at a rate of around 2 Hz (2 updates/second). I also have a working driver sketch for the temperature probe, and I plan on 
            combined these two programs, along with others in the final version of the driver sketch program.
        </p>

            Success!! A Working pH Meter and Thermocouple.

        <img src="./Images/pH_meter_thermometer.jpg">

        <p>
            Figure 2.) One of the most exciting moments this week was getting the drivers for the pH meter and thermocouple up and running. Since 
            I don't have any real calibrating solutions on hand at the moment, I decided to calibrate the pH probe using milk and 
            vinegar. As awful as that sounds, the attempt went well and I managed to produce some surprisingly accurate values when 
            I tested it with an off-curve calibration standard (pH=6.86).

            Week 7: Integrating Sensors and Formatting the Serial Monitor Output
        </h4>
        <p>
            During <a href="#week_7">Week 7</a> I was able to combine drivers for pH, temperature and 
            total dissolved solids (TDS) and collect streaming measurements from all three instruments at 
            once in the serial monitor. I learned about baud rate synchronization this week when I discovered
            that Arduino TDS sensors typically operate at a 115200 baud rate frequency, which is 12 times higher 
            than the pH or temperature probes typically operate. I managed to compensate for these differences 
            in communication rates by modifying the TDS to operate at a 9600 baud rate, at the cost of some 
            additional start-up time owing to the increased buffer time needed to collect TDS sensor measurements.

            Figure 4.) Serial monitor output displaying the default start up TDS meter response. The pH meter has been calibrated and 
            is currently held in a pH testing standard (6.86) that was not used in the calibration and has been used to house the pH 
            probe for a couple of days.

            Figure 5.) Serial monitor output displaying an initial measurement of the TDS probe after 
            equilibration. This nutrient solution was replaced about 2 days ago, so this is TDS measurement should represent a nice baseline. 
            The pH measurement is from 2-day old 6.86 pH buffer solution. The water from my refrigerator registers at 180ppm (TDS units) on this device.
        </p>

        <p>
            An electromagnetic interference appears to occur in the pH probe whenever it is held in the same nutrient solution as the TDS sensor. 
            This happens because of the way each meter performs its' task. TDS operates on a principle that is sometimes referred to as "amperage-driven 
            voltage detection". Essentially, the TDS meter tests the conductivity of the solution by emitting tiny pulses of electric current and reading 
            the voltage accross the anode/cathode gap. The pH probe uses the principle of passive voltage detection to measure the relative concentration 
            of cations (i.e., H+) and anions (i.e., OH-) in the solution. Placing the pH and TDS meters in the same solution causes the pH probe to act 
            erratically, due to the percieved abundance of negative charge released by the cathode of the TDS sensor. This excess current registers in the 
            pH meters' passive voltage scale as an abundance of anions in solution, causing it to report a falsely elevated pH. 
        </p>

        <p>            
            Given this observation it appears reasonable to assume that maintaining the pH and TDS probes on seperate Baud frequencies could 
            offset the effect of this interference. After testing this hypothesis, I concluded that the pH and TDS meter can share no more than two of the 
            following three testing conditions with each other: {baud_rate, test_solution, time_period}. Running the sensors on different baud rates 
            is not an option, because the serial monitor can maintain only one Baud rate frequency at a time. Making time-scale decoupling the only option for 
            creating a stand-alone measurement system with all three sensors. 


        </p>
        <p>
            Since I maintain both of my hydroponic systems identically, the measurements these systems produce may be considered equivalent within a negligible margin 
            of error (i.e., less than 10%). Given this fact, I have decided to temporarily resolve this system timing issue by placing the TDS sensor in the other 
            system reservior, which should provide a reasonable "best of both worlds" solution at the cost of staking the accuracy of these measurements on the precision 
            of my solution preps.
        </p>    
        <p>
            This should provide a relatively accurate estimate of system pH and TDS measurements in each unit, while allowing the pH and TDS sensors to remain 
            online and operate simultaneously. I plan to revisit this issue of time-scale decoupling once the online API, dashboard, and database have been 
            developed.
